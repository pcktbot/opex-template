# ASSETS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your un-compiled assets such as LESS, SASS, or JavaScript.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/assets#webpacked).

> Files are not automatically imported into the app. Add each file to `nuxt.config.js` under 'assets' to import globally or import directly within a component.

- TODO: write function to automatically add paths to global SCSS files within the assets folder.

## TRANSITIONS

Vue can use Named transitions when animating between components.
